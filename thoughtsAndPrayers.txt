  Current Issue: 
 get coordinates is able to get coordinates for 134 out of 166 resorts with openWeather Api; 
 for about 30 resorts 
  - get coorditnates for each resort in pass db and save in 
  - use zip codes for GeoCoding api to grab coordinates for weather search
  - build controller for weather search
  - save weather api data in DB
  
    server: 
      - build an endpoint that will contain data extraction logic and save the resulting data it in the DB
      sources of data collection: weatherApi, cheerio, 
  




  based on the selected season pass option, user selected location, and radius, api should  fetch data for relevant ski resorts only;
  cache data results in database;



  sign in and sign up should account for edge cases, such as 404, 401 api responses, etc.

  Sign In/Up elements should render conditionally depending on request success/failure. Currently navidate('/home) on all;
  - 
Main goal: 
  - Focus on building functional front end routes
  - Learn integration and set up of external API's
  - Adjust server and client to the functinality added by openWeatherApi, googleMaps, dataScraper
List of UI components to build :

  1. Implement existing Components, Debug; add  and implement missing components: Home,  Map & list.  
  2. Google maps with pins (make it occupy  entire viewport width )
  3. Search results table (hovers above and over map)
  4. Snow search component (hovers above and  over  map)
